## Operational Risk: Framework & Strategies

### Operational Risk Management Setup
#### Operational Risk and Management
##### Operational Risk (Op Risk) Management

- **Definition**: Op risk involves potential losses due to inadequate or failed processes, people, systems, or external events.  
- **Regulatory Scope**:
  - Defined by the Basel Committee.
  - Excludes strategic and reputational risks.
  - Focuses on internal/external fraud, system failures, and compliance breaches.

---
##### Sources of Op Risk
1. **Process Risks**: 
   - Execution, delivery, business disruption, system failure.
2. **Conduct Risks**: 
   - Client relations, product/business practices, employment, internal fraud.
3. **External Risks**: 
   - Theft, fraud, damage to assets, cyber threats (e.g., hacking).

---
##### Examples of Op Risk
- **Internal Fraud**: Inappropriate practices, market conduct violations.
- **Business Continuity**: Failure to operate during catastrophes.
- **Vendor Management**: Third-party poor practices.
- **Financial Integrity**: Poor accounting, non-compliance.
- **Information Security**: Data breaches, customer information leaks.

---
##### Three Lines of Defense
1. **Business Lines**:
   - Directly manage and own risks; allocate risk capital efficiently.
2. **Risk Management and Compliance**:
   - Work with business lines to enforce risk limits.
3. **Internal Audit**:
   - Provide independent assurance of compliance with policies.

---
##### Key Observations

#### Capital Requirement

##### Risk Capital Distribution in Banks
- **Credit Risk**: Largest component of risk capital (due to lending business).
- **Market Risk**: Varies greatly across banks (high in trading-focused banks, low in clearing/custody banks).
- **Operational Risk**: Accounts for 18% (Goldman Sachs) to 45% (State Street) of total risk capital.
  
---
##### Basel Committee Common Equity Ratio Calculation
- **Formula**: 
  - Common equity ratio = Adjusted Common Equity / (Credit risk-weighted assets + Market risk-weighted assets + Operational risk-weighted assets).
  - Basel recommends a ratio of >8%.
- **Operational Risk Capital for GSIBs**: 
  - Average Common Equity Ratio: 11.7% (well above 8% threshold).
  - Operational risk capital allocated is $411 billion.

---
##### Basel Standardized Approach for Operational Risk Capital (K sub TSA)
- **Calculation**: 
  - Formula: (Sum of gross income of 8 business lines × Beta for each business line) / 3 (for 3 years).
  - **Scaling**: Adjusts capital based on activity level in each business and its associated risk.
  
- **Beta Factors**:
  - Corporate finance, trading, and payment & settlement: 18% (highest).
  - Retail banking, asset management, retail brokerage: 12% (lowest).

---
###### **Example Calculation**
- **Year 1**: 
  - Retail Banking gross income = $200M × 12% Beta = $24M (capital charge).
  - Total capital charge = Negative → Assumed to be zero.
- **Year 2**: Sum of capital charges = $2.25M.
- **Year 3**: Sum of capital charges = $4.68M.
- **Average Capital Charge**: (0 + 2.25 + 4.68) / 3 = $2.31M.

---
