Got it! Since your notes are already in the Codespace, we can skip the cloning step. Here's the updated and simplified guide tailored to your setup:

# Running Q&A in GitHub Codespaces with Notes from a Markdown File

This guide will walk you through setting up GitHub Codespaces, installing Ollama, downloading the Mistral 7B model, and generating Q&A from your existing Markdown file. You can specify the **number of questions** and the **topic to focus on** for customization.

---

## Step 1: Check System Resources
Ensure your GitHub Codespace meets the minimum requirements:
- **4 CPU cores**
- **8GB RAM**
- **10GB storage**

Run the following commands to check system resources:
```bash
# Check CPU cores
lscpu | grep "CPU(s):"

# Check RAM
free -h

# Check storage
df -h
```

---

## Step 2: Install Ollama
Ollama is a lightweight tool for running AI models. Install it using the following commands:
```bash
# Download and install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

#Run ollama
ollama serve

# Verify installation in a new terminal
ollama --version
```

---

## Step 3: Download Mistral 7B
Download the Mistral 7B language model using Ollama:
```bash
# Pull the Mistral 7B model
ollama pull mistral
```

---

## Step 4: Create a Flexible Q&A Generation Script
Create a Python script (`generate_qa.py`) that takes the following inputs:
1. **Path to the Markdown file** (already in your Codespace).
2. **Number of questions** to generate.
3. **Topic to focus on** for the questions.

Hereâ€™s the script:

```python
# generate_qa.py
import subprocess
import csv
import os

def start_ollama():
    """Start the Ollama server."""
    print("Starting Ollama server...")
    ollama_process = subprocess.Popen(["ollama", "serve"])
    time.sleep(5)  # Wait for the server to start
    return ollama_process

def kill_ollama(ollama_process):
    """Kill the Ollama server."""
    print("Stopping Ollama server...")
    ollama_process.terminate()
    ollama_process.wait()

def generate_qa(markdown_file, num_questions, focus_topic, output_folder):
    # Read the Markdown file
    with open(markdown_file, "r") as file:
        notes = file.read()

    # Prepare the prompt for Mistral 7B
    prompt = (
        f"Generate {num_questions} questions and answers based on the following notes. "
        f"Focus the questions on the topic of '{focus_topic}'. "
        "Each question should be a maximum of 2 sentences, and each answer should be less than 50 words. "
        "Format the output as a list of questions and answers, with each pair separated by a newline. "
        "Here are the notes:\n\n{notes}"
    )

    # Run Ollama with Mistral 7B to generate Q&A
    result = subprocess.run(
        ["ollama", "run", "mistral", prompt],
        capture_output=True,
        text=True
    )

    # Parse the output into questions and answers
    qa_pairs = []
    output_lines = result.stdout.split("\n")
    for i in range(0, len(output_lines) - 1, 2):
        question = output_lines[i].strip()
        answer = output_lines[i + 1].strip() if i + 1 < len(output_lines) else ""
        qa_pairs.append((question, answer))

    # Save the Q&A pairs to a CSV file
    os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)  # Create the output folder if it doesn't exist
    output_file = os.path.join(output_folder, f"qa_output_{focus_topic.replace(' ', '_')}.csv")
    
    with open(output_file, "w", newline="") as csvfile:
        writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
        writer.writerow(["Question", "Answer"])  # Write header
        writer.writerows(qa_pairs)  # Write Q&A pairs

    print(f"Q&A generated and saved to {output_file}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Inputs
    markdown_file = input("Enter the path to your Markdown file (e.g., notes.md): ")
    num_questions = input("Enter the number of questions to generate: ")
    focus_topic = input("Enter the topic to focus on for the questions: ")
    output_folder = input("Enter the folder to save the output CSV file (e.g., output): ")

    # Generate Q&A
    generate_qa(markdown_file, int(num_questions), focus_topic, output_folder)
```

---

## Step 5: Run the Script
Execute the script and provide the required inputs:
```bash
python3 generate_qa.py
```

Example inputs:
- **Markdown file path**: `notes.md` (or the path to your existing Markdown file in the Codespace).
- **Number of questions**: `5`
- **Topic to focus on**: `machine learning`

The script will generate a file named `qa_output_machine_learning.md` containing the Q&A.

---

## Step 6: Review the Generated Q&A
Open the generated file to review the Q&A:
```bash
cat qa_output_machine_learning.md
```

---

## Step 7: Start the Ollama API Server (Optional)
If you need remote access to the model, start the Ollama API server:
```bash
# Start the Ollama API server
ollama serve
```

The API server will run on `http://localhost:11434`. You can interact with it using HTTP requests.

---

### Example Workflow
1. Check system resources.
2. Install Ollama.
3. Download Mistral 7B.
4. Run the `generate_qa.py` script and provide inputs:
   - Path to your existing Markdown file.
   - Number of questions.
   - Topic to focus on.
5. Review the output in the generated file (e.g., `qa_output_machine_learning.md`).
6. (Optional) Start the Ollama API server for remote access.

---

### Notes
- Ensure your Codespace has sufficient resources to run the model.
- Adjust the file paths in the script as needed for your specific setup.
- For advanced usage, refer to the [Ollama documentation](https://ollama.ai/docs).

This version of the guide assumes your Markdown file is already in the Codespace, making it simpler and more direct. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
